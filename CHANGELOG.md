# Changelog

## How to read this file

Koinome tracks **three coordinated versions**:

| version | where | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CLI** | `pyproject.toml`, `koinome/__init__.py` | Koinome CLI package (PyPI) |
| **Template** | `koinome/version.py`, manifest `template_version` | corpus folder tooling/guidance (`koinome upgrade`) |
| **Conformance** | `koinome/version.py`, manifest `conformance_version` | Validator and `check_corpus` contract |

A template or conformance change that alters what constitutes a valid note is **compatibility-relevant**. See `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`.

Versioning is **paused at 0.0.0** for template and conformance during the reliability hardening cycle (AUX-001–AUX-011). The CLI published its first PyPI alpha as **`0.0.0alpha1`** under the `koinome` package name.

## 0.0.0alpha1 — first PyPI alpha (CLI only; template 0.0.0, conformance 0.0.0)

- First intentional publish to PyPI under the **`koinome`** package name.
- Product rename; managed folders are **corpora**.
- Install: `pip install koinome==0.0.0alpha1` or `uv tool install koinome==0.0.0alpha1`.

## Accidental / unsupported index releases

### PyPI 2.0.0 on a mistaken legacy project (do not use)

Published in error before the repository reset source versions to `0.0.0`. Not a supported release. See `docs/RELEASE.md` for yank or supersede strategy.

## Unreleased — hardening cycle (template 0.0.0, conformance 0.0.0)

- Relicensed repository **MIT → Apache-2.0** per [strategy](docs/STRATEGY.md) D6; added DCO via [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (no CLA). Published PyPI **`0.0.0alpha1`** remains MIT metadata; the next release carries Apache-2.0.
- Published [docs/STRATEGY.md](docs/STRATEGY.md); realigned README, comparisons, usage, evaluation, and governance ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).
- `koinome init` as an alias for `koinome new` (strategy demo naming).
- Removed legacy on-disk migration paths, one-off transform scripts, and `docs/MIGRATION.md`.
- **Fixed:** MOC freshness no longer depends on the calendar. `gen_mocs.py` stamped `created`/`updated` with today's date on every run and never read existing frontmatter back, so `koinome check` failed on any corpus older than a day even when its content was unchanged. The generator now preserves an existing `created` and moves `updated` only when the rest of the MOC changes. Existing corpora pick this up through `koinome upgrade` (it replaces `.scripts/gen_mocs.py`, backing up your copy, and regenerates MOCs). (template tooling)
- Made `koinome/template/.scripts/pre-commit` tracked-executable (`100755`) to match the materialized corpus copies; the installed hook is unchanged (`bootstrap.sh` still `chmod +x`es `.git/hooks/pre-commit`).
- Added `.github/workflows/examples-check.yml`: runs `koinome check` against the committed reference corpora — without rebuilding — on pull requests and on a daily schedule, catching clock-dependent generator drift that a same-day build-and-check cannot.

Reliability and release-hardening work on `master` after the version reset:

- Validator and git gates (staged snapshot, exit codes, conformance check)
- Sync integrity (quarantine branches, per-repo lock)
- Config as canonical authority in agent guidance
- Transactional upgrade with manifest verification
- Bootstrap/packaging safety (no system Python mutation, skill refresh, wheel coverage)
- Release and compatibility discipline (AUX-011)
- Reference corpora and deterministic evaluation harness (AUX-012)
- Removed `import-obsidian` and all Obsidian migration tooling

Verify with `bash scripts/check_release.sh` before any publish.

## Historical development (pre-hardening reset)

The entries below describe early development **before** the `0.0.0` pause. They are archived context, not supported releases under current governance. Template and CLI version numbers in these sections do not match current source.

### 1.3.1 — portable shell scripts (template)

- Fix pre-commit hook on macOS bash 3.2: replace `mapfile` with a NUL-delimited read loop.
- Make `koinome-sync.sh` portable: drop Linux-only `flock`, replace GNU `date -Iseconds`.
- Document bash 3.2 / POSIX baseline; re-run `./bootstrap.sh` after upgrade to refresh the hook.
- Add `scripts/lint-shell.sh` and CI shellcheck workflow.

### 1.3.0 — setup-domains skill (template)

- New `setup-domains` skill: interview, propose domains, update config and folders, regenerate MOCs, validate, commit.
- AGENTS.md points new corpora at `setup-domains` first.

### 1.2.0 — agent skills (template)

- Provider-agnostic Agent Skills in `.skills/` (session close, validation fix, synthesis, new note, ADR, todo, weekly review, seed distillation).
- `bootstrap.sh` links skills into `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.gemini/skills`, and `.cursor/skills/`.
- `skip_dirs` extended so skill directories are excluded from validation and MOC generation.

### 1.2.1 — CLI help clarity (CLI)

- Print usage instead of an error when the CLI is invoked with no subcommand.
- Clarify in help text which commands run outside a corpus versus which take a corpus path.

### 1.2.0 — domain bootstrap skill (CLI)

- Simplify `koinome new` wizard to three steps (name, location, review); no preset domains.
- Add `setup-domains` agent skill for tailoring subject folders after creation.

### 1.1.0 — guided corpus creation (CLI)

- Rework `koinome new` interactive wizard: plain-language steps, domain preset, creation preview, live bootstrap progress, agent-oriented next steps.

### 1.0.1 — packaging fix (CLI)

- Ship `template/` and `importers/` inside the installed package so `uv tool install` and `pip install` can run `koinome new`, `koinome upgrade`, and `koinome seed`.
- Remove stray root-level `done.txt` from the template (tasks live in `72-tasks/`).

### 1.0.0 — initial public experiment (CLI + template)

Early public experiment before governance hardening:

- `koinome new`, `koinome seed`, `koinome doctor`, `koinome upgrade`
- Governed corpus: config-driven validator, pre-commit hook, generated MOCs, git sync with conflict quarantine
- Synthesis layer with provenance and staleness detection
